        <p class="text">
          We often refer to our expanding universe with one simple word: space.
          But where does space begin and, more importantly, what is it?
          <br />
          <br />
          Space is an almost perfect vacuum, nearly void of matter and with
          extremely low pressure. In space, sound doesn't carry because there
          aren't molecules close enough together to transmit sound between them.
          Not quite empty, bits of gas, dust and other matter floats around
          "emptier" areas of the universe, while more crowded regions can host
          planets, stars and galaxies.
          <br />
          <br />
          From our Earth-bound perspective, outer space is most often thought to
          begin about 62 miles (100 kilometers) above sea level at what is known
          as the Kármán line. This is an imaginary boundary at an altitude where
          there is no appreciable air to breathe or scatter light. Passing this
          altitude, blue starts to give way to black because oxygen molecules
          are not in enough abundance to make the sky blue.

          The station was designed between 1984 and 1993. Elements of the
          station were in construction throughout the US, Canada, Japan, and
          Europe beginning in the late 1980s.

          The International Space Station Program brings together international
          flight crews, multiple launch vehicles, globally distributed launch
          and flight operations, training, engineering, and development
          facilities, communications networks, and the international scientific
          research community.

          <h5 class="desc">Moon</h5>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits at an average
          distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), about 30 times the diameter of
          Earth. Tidal forces between Earth and the Moon have over time
          synchronized the Moon's orbital period (lunar month) with its rotation
          period (lunar day) at 29.5 Earth days, causing the same side of the
          Moon to always face Earth. The Moon's gravitational pull – and to a
          lesser extent, the Sun's – are the main drivers of Earth's tides.
          <br />
          <br />
          Earth's Moon is the brightest and largest object in our night sky. The
          Moon makes Earth a more livable planet by moderating our home planet's
          wobble on its axis, leading to a relatively stable climate. It also
          causes tides, creating a rhythm that has guided humans for thousands
          of years.

          <h5 class="desc">Nebula</h5>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          A nebula is a giant cloud of dust and gas in space. Some nebulae (more
          than one nebula) come from the gas and dust thrown out by the
          explosion of a dying star, such as a supernova. Other nebulae are
          regions where new stars are beginning to form. For this reason, some
          nebulae are called "star nurseries.
          <br />
          <br />
          Nebulae are made of dust and gases—mostly hydrogen and helium. The
          dust and gases in a nebula are very spread out, but gravity can slowly
          begin to pull together clumps of dust and gas. As these clumps get
          bigger and bigger, their gravity gets stronger and stronger.
          <br />
          <br />
          Eventually, the clump of dust and gas gets so big that it collapses
          from its own gravity. The collapse causes the material at the center
          of the cloud to heat up-and this hot core is the beginning of a star.
